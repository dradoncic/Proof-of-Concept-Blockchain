Blockchain is valid

## How it Works
Uses a number of cryptographic protocol libraries to implement SHA256 transaction hashing and Elliptic-Curve Public and Private Key Generation. 

This POC Blockchain is implemented using UTXO's rather than an acoount based implementation.

EX.

Send: 1.2    Balance: 10.0

Change: 8.8  Balance: 8.8

Network forms a larger transaction from all the smaller/medium size UTXO's held in someones wallet.
